## Introduction
Following my work-linked training, my company asked me to create a todoList. With Javascript and NodeJS languages
The todoList uses APIs with the Express socket. Routes to add or remove tasks. But also to be able to edit 
a stain, or to finish it off.

## Installation
For the installation of the project everything is explained in the **chapters folder**, then the **installation** directory.

Javascript, CSS, HTML

## API
API is an acronym for Applications Programming Interface. An API is therefore a programming interface that allows you to "plug in" to an application to exchange data. It operates on an input/output agreement, it is a distribution channel. A API is open and offered by the program owner. It is a concept and an intangible element.
